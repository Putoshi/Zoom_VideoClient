# Zoom Instant SDK

The Web SDK enables the development of video applications powered by Zoom’s core framework inside an HTML5 web client through a highly optimized WebAssembly module.

As an extension of the Zoom browser client, this SDK is intended for implementations where the end user has a low-bandwidth environment, is behind a network firewall, or has restrictions on their machine which would prevent them from installing the Zoom Desktop or Mobile Clients.

## Compatibility

The Web SDK is compatible with major mainstream browsers. See the following table for the details.
